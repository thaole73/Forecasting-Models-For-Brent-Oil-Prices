**Problem Description**

Oil is a vital commodity in ternational trade and plays an irreplacable part in our daily life. It is used for various purpose: production, home-cooking, transportation, heating, ect. Because of its importance, oil prices have always been an amusing topic and drawn huge interest from people. Furthermore, the fear of a recession together with extended sanctions against Russian oil exports have increased uncertainty in oil prices. It motivated me to perform price analysis on historical data of Brent Oil Price to get insights and make price prediction using ARIMA model.

**Business Objectives:** Perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and Forecast Brent Oil Prices

**Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/historical-brent-oil-price-from-2000-to-202204

**Data Mining Method:** 4 machine learning regression techniques will be used to predict oil prices

**Statistical modeling identification:** This project will calculate three metrics MSE(mean squared error), MAE (mean absolute error), and R2 (r-squared) to select best model
